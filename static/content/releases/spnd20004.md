order: 996
title: SPND20004
description: The Belgium-inspired Hedgehog Mix of Sharp Lank was too good not to
  put it out. Also, introducing Dajusch to Spandau 20 feels even more easy with
  a tune like Make Me Scream, which (unsurprisingly) is an absolute screamer.
  FJAAK round off the package with Back In The 70's, and so, SPANDAU20 004 is
  complete, another worthy entry to the series.
