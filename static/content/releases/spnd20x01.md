title: SPND20X01
description: "From Spandau to Kreuzberg and beyond: Rifts contributes a classy
  techno track that is constantly raising tension. We are happy to have J.Manuel
  for the first time! His sensible and deep productions leave us longing for
  more. The newbies FJAAK debut with a strong electro banger on our new X
  series! Watch out for these unknown talents! Fresh from the south of Spandau,
  Claus Schoening is landing his third piece on our label with a crisp and
  concentrated techno meditation."
